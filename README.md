# üåç Water Contamination Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project investigates mortality rates linked to water contamination across multiple nations, with a focus on general, male, and female mortality rates. The analysis explores global disparities, visualizes differences across continents, and identifies the countries with the lowest and highest mortality rates within each region.

The project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to uncover insights about global water contamination and its human impact.

## üìä Methodology & Steps
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Loaded mortality dataset.  
   - Cleaned and structured data by gender (general, male, female).  
   - Organized country data by continent.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Investigated mortality patterns by gender.  
   - Compared variations across continents.  

3. **Visualization**
   - Created bar graphs to visualize mortality rates across countries within each continent.  
   - Compared highest vs lowest mortality rate countries** per continent.  

4. **Insights & Conclusions**
   - Highlighted global disparities in water contamination impacts.  
   - Identified regions and demographics most affected.

## Example Visuals
The notebook generates bar graphs such as:
- Mortality rate comparisons across continents.  
- Male vs Female mortality rates.  
- Highest vs lowest mortality countries per continent.
